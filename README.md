uCNC mechanics remix
====================

This is a remix (rebuild, really) of the mechanical part of the
_uCNC Controller_ by **dherrendoerfer** :

  https://github.com/dherrendoerfer/uCNC_controller

The 3D printable CNC mechanical parts have been re-designed in OpenSCAD based on
the original design, but have been made parametric so that they can be easily
scalled or modified to fit other specific requirements.

The uCNC overall design is very nice and it was made for 28BYJ-48 stepper motors
which I already have. Also note that order to draw a sample of the designs with
the motors fitted, you will need the excellent OpenSCAD _28BYJ-48_ stepper
drawing by **RGriffoGoes**:

X Bridges
=========
The X Bridges follows the original uCNC design very closely, but is made from a
base design for both sides, and then additions per side for the motor and
bearing mounts.

The motor side mount is specific for the 28BYJ-48 motor (althought still
customisable), but the bearing side is easier to adapt using variables.
